    "products": 4,
    "orders": 4,

## 🛡️ **Smart Seeding**

- **Idempotent**: Won't create duplicates if data already exists
- **Relationship-aware**: Creates proper connections between entities
- **Realistic**: Uses real addresses, proper order calculations, and meaningful reviews
- **User-dependent**: Uses existing seeded users for orders and reviews

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Must seed users first** - The seed data requires existing users
2. **Environment protection** - Dev endpoints only work in non-production
3. **Real addresses** - Uses actual US addresses for testing
4. **Proper calculations** - Orders include tax, shipping, and discounts
5. **Verified reviews** - Some reviews marked as verified purchases

## 🎯 **Full Test Flow**

```bash
# 1. Reset everything
POST /dev/reset-database

# 2. Create users

# 3. Create all data
